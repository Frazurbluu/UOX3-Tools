2nd March, 2006 - Maarc
	Added a basic ClassicBookScript and ClassicBookSection class.  Note that this is *incomplete*, and requires testing against real data (which I don't have at the moment).
	Added a very basic DictionaryScript and UOXIni class.  They are a subclass of Script, with no additional information.  Essentially, they just *are* normal Scripts, but this way, we can conceptualise it a bit better.

1st March, 2006 - Maarc
	Added a AccountScript and AccountSection class, for dealing with Accounts files
	Fixed a possible bug with script parsing that only became apparent with AccountScript (if the delimiter appeared more than once, we weren't adding it in properly for the value part)
	Added an AddSection routine to BaseScript, so one you create you can readily add in


28th February, 2006 - Maarc
	Updated DefinitionTree so you can get a Collection based on the DFN Category you want (GetCollection() method)
	Added empty constructors for BaseScript(), WorldFile90() and Script(), so that we can create empty ones for populating later (not forced reads)

24th February, 2006 - Maarc
	Added SpawnRegion.cs, DefinitionCollection.cs, and DefinitionTree.cs
	Updated TownRegion parsing code so that it parsees a WorldSection and a ScriptSection separately
	DefinitionContainer = all the definitions dealing with a particular category of DFN
	DefinitionTree = one DefinitionContainer per DFN Cat collection

	eg code for DefinitionTree

		UOXData.Script.DefinitionTree dfnTree = new UOXData.Script.DefinitionTree( dfnPath );
		UOXData.Script.ScriptSection mSect = dfnTree.FindEntry( "RACE 1", UOXData.Script.DFN_Categories.race );
		if( mSect != null )
			System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show( "Hooray!  Race found" );


21st February, 2006 - Maarc
	Updated the ToolAPI so that it now reads/parses TownRegions, from either a worldfile or dfn file
