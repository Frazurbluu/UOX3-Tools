Tidied up a couple of swap bugs (thanks to Krrios)
Closed the right file number (Krrios again).
Added support for the mark, gate and recall properties
Readjusted the property layout

Known issues:

Redrawing issues when going from a smaller scale factor (ie 1/16) to a larger one (1/8).  Property frame doesn't draw correctly.
Work around: Tab through the frame to see everything

Changing scaling factors forces a map display redraw (select it from the menu).
