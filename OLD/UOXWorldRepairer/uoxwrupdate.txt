Please note that there are still a few issues with this program.  For one, 0 serial'd items and chars appear which I cannot find.  Most likely they're non-existent chars/items in the world.  (ie INITMEM in the save files being more than the actual amount).

Future improvements
* Guild loading/browsing/diagnosing
* More item/char diagnostics
* Better skin support
* Invalid multi support
* Actual repairs

For the moment, most things fall into a few category of errors.  For characters, it's almost always a duplicate layer problem.  Select the character in the char errors section from the combo list.  It'll list off the serials of all the items at the same layer.  Find those serials in your world files, and set the CONT value to -1.  (places them on the ground).  This is a source of the missing items problems that occurs with players/NPCs occasionally.

Item errors:

Most frequently it's invalid spawners, owners, containers, or location.  If it's location, go into the world files and set the x,y and z values to something valid.  If it's owners or spawners, go into the items.wsc files and find them.  Delete the OWNER and SPAWNER lines associated with them.  For containers, it falls into one of two categories.  It thinks it is a container to itself (fixed by UOX on startup), or the container it belongs to no longer exists.  In that instance, go into the world file and set CONT to -1.

You will find some other issues (str, dex, and int) with items.  If these are a problem, go into items.wsc, find your item, and set these values to 0.
